concurrency:
  # Prevent concurrent releases on the same branch to avoid tag conflicts (e.g., "latest" on the main branch).
  # Concurrent releases on different branches are allowed, as their tags don't overlap.
  #
  # Note: GitHub's concurrency model cancels any *pending* job in the same group when a new one is queued.
  # This means that if multiple release requests are made in quick succession on the *same* branch,
  # only the latest one will proceed — which is acceptable, since it includes all previous changes.
  #
  # However, using the same concurrency group across *different* branches could result in a release
  # request for one branch canceling a pending release for another branch — which is *not* acceptable.
  #
  # Therefore, we scope concurrency to both the workflow and the branch.
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} # e.g. Release-main
  # Never cancel an ongoing release to prevent harmful interruptions
