## ‚ú® Features

* **[Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)-based image**
* **Lightweight**: ~360 MB
* **Minimalist**: Includes only essential dependencies to reduce image size and surface area
* **UID-agnostic**: Supports running the server with a custom/arbitrary UID (typically required when running container
  in [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift))
* **Rootless**: Runs as a non-root user by default if no UID is specified
* **Multi-architecture support**: Built for `amd64` & `arm64` _(additional architectures available on request)_
* **JRE 21**, based on [Eclipse Temurin](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin)
  * Custom-built using `jlink` to minimize size
  * Includes all standard Java modules to ensure broad compatibility with plugins
* **Frequent security scans**: By relying on [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) and [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/)

### üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

The image is under active development, with the following enhancements planned:

* **Healthcheck integration**: Built-in Docker `HEALTHCHECK` instruction for better container observability.
* **Unified configuration interface**: Centralized PaperMC tuning via a config file, with optional environment variable overrides (which will be the main difference with [itzg's solution](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/interpolating/)).
* **Customizable server startup options**: Ability to set JVM options and server properties via environment variables.
* **Enable/Disable Aikar's flags**: Aikar's researches ([link](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/)) and [PaperMC recommendations](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags/)
* **Configurable TimeZone**
* **Auto-updating builds**: Scheduled rebuilds for including upstream JDK/PaperMC updates and security patches.
* **Compliancy with [OWASP Docker rules](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)**
* **GraalVM variant**

The below features may be implemented too, but are not a priority:

* **Configurable Java module set**: Option to build smaller JREs by selecting only required Java modules.
* **Support JMX**: Java Management Extensions enabling for remote management and monitoring (e.g., with [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/), [JMC](https://openjdk.org/projects/jmc/), ...) => [spark](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/profiling/) may be preferred.
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all features and configurations with [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/).
* **Share examples**
* **OpenJ9 variant**
